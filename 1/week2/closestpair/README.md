# Closest Pair

This algorithm finds the closest pair of points on a 2D plane.

Two algorithms are implemented. 

1. The naive algorithm is O(nÂ²)
2. The fast algorithm is O(n log n)


There are some comparisons built in to show the run-time difference.

### benchmark

example output with n = 10000 (i.e. 10,000 points on the graph)

Looks like in this case the nlogn algorithm is roughly two orders of magnitude faster than the naive implementation. And it just grows faster as the input gets larger! This was really cool to see after spending all weekend trying to understand and get this crazy algorithm working. :)
