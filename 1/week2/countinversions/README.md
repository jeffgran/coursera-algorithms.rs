# Count Inversions

An "inversion" is defined as a pair of elements in the array that occur in non-sorted order.

Amazingly, a fast (`O(n log(n))`) way to calculate the number of inversions is to Merge-Sort the list, and just keep track of a little bookkeeping meanwhile.

So I just copied my [Merge Sort](../../week1/mergesort) agorithm and added the bookkeeping code.
