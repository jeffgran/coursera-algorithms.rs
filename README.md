# What is this repo?

This repo contains all the code I wrote for the Coursera Algorithms Specialty, consisting of 4 4-week long courses taught by Tim Roughgarden of Stanford University.

## Organization

There are 4 courses:

1. [Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms](1/)
2. Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures
3. Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming
4. Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them
